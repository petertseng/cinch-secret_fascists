# cinch-secret_fascists

This is an IRC bot using [cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch), [cinch-game-bot](https://github.com/petertseng/cinch-game-bot), and [secret_fascists](https://github.com/petertseng/secret_fascists) to allow play-by-IRC of "Secret Fascists" by Max Temkin:

The astute will note that this is not the actual name of the game.
Fortunately, that does not really matter, as the name of the Fascist leader is configurable per game.
